# AREA CALCULATOR 

This Python script is an interactive console application designed to calculate the area of different geometric shapes: a square, a rectangle, and a circle. Users can select the shape for which they want to calculate the area, input the necessary dimensions, and receive the computed area.

## Features

- **Square**: Calculates the area given the side length.
- **Rectangle**: Calculates the area given the length and breadth.
- **Circle**: Calculates the area given the radius.
- **Exit**: Ends the program.

## Usage

1. **Run the Script**:
  - Execute the script in a Python environment.
2. **Follow the Instructions**:
  - The script will prompt you to select a shape by entering a number corresponding to the shape.
  - Input the required dimensions when prompted.
  - The script will display the calculated area.
  - Repeat or exit as desired.

## Notes

- **Error Handling**: This script does not handle non-numeric input gracefully. Additional validation could be added to ensure robustness.
- **Mathematical Accuracy**: For more accurate circle area calculations, consider using the `math.pi` constant from the `math` module.
